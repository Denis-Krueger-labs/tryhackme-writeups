# TryHackMe Writeups

This repository contains structured technical reports documenting selected TryHackMe rooms.

The focus is on methodology, technical reasoning, and defensive considerations rather than step-by-step flag disclosure.

No real-world systems were targeted.

Rooms are categorized by difficulty:
- easy/
- medium/
- hard/

Each room contains:
- A technical report
- Sanitized scan results
- Supporting notes (where relevant)

## Methodology
